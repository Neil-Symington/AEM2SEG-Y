# AEM2SEG-Y
The AEM2SEG-Y package is a julia library that converts AEM conductivity line data into the SEG-Y format, which is commonly used for storing geophysical datasets such as reflection seismic or GPR. This allows AEM conductivity models to be imported visualised and ultimately interpreted within seismic software.

This package was previously written in python but managing a deprecated version of obspy became to cumbersome and the process was tyoo slow. The current implementation is much faster.
