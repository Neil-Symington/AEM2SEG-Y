# AEM2SEG-Y
The AEM2SEG-Y package that converts AEM conductivity line data into the SEG-Y format, which is commonly used for storing geophysical datasets such as reflection seismic or GPR. This allows AEM conductivity models to be imported visualised and ultimately interpreted within seismic software.
